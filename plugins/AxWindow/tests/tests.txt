# DPI Scaling Test
[ ] App respects DPI settings by scaling correctly

# Multi-Display DPI Scaling Test
Setup: Configure two monitors, each with different DPI settings
[ ] App moves from display to display and accounts for DPI changes between monitors

# Custom cursor
[ ] Normal windows cursor is replaced with custom cursor

# Normal Cursor
Setup: Create decorated resizable window
[ ] Cursor is visible inside the client area
[ ] Cursor position at the left most pixel of the window equals zero
[ ] Cursor position at the right most pixel of the window equals its width
[ ] Cursor position at the top most pixel of the window equals zero
[ ] Cursor position at the bottom most pixel of the window equals its height
[ ] Cursor position stops updating when outside of the window (no negative values)
[ ] Cursor position keeps updating even when not in focus
[ ] Cursor position does not keep updating when minimized
[ ] Delta is negative in the X and Y axis when going left and up respectively
[ ] Delta is positive in the X and Z axis when going right and down respectively

# Hidden Cursor Test
[ ] Cursor is invisible while inside the client area but visible again when not
[ ] Cursor position at the left most pixel of the window equals zero
[ ] Cursor position at the right most pixel of the window equals its width
[ ] Cursor position at the top most pixel of the window equals zero
[ ] Cursor position at the bottom most pixel of the window equals its height
[ ] Cursor position stops updating when outside of the window (no negative values)
[ ] Cursor position keeps updating even when not in focus
[ ] Cursor position does not keep updating when minimized
[ ] Delta is negative in the X and Y axis when going left and up respectively
[ ] Delta is positive in the X and Z axis when going right and down respectively

# Disabled Cursor
[ ] Cursor X position keeps decreasing as it dragged past the left most pixel on the display
[ ] Cursor X position keeps increasing as it dragged past the right most pixel on the display
[ ] Cursor Y position keeps decreasing as it dragged past the top most pixel on the display
[ ] Cursor Y position keeps increasing as it dragged past the bottom most pixel on the display
[ ] Cursor position stops updating when minimized
[ ] Cursor position stops updating when not in focus
[ ] Clicking well outside the expected client area does not cause window to lose focus
[ ] Setting mouse at known position, alt-tabbing into window, moving, and then alt-tabbing back does not move mouse position
[ ] Only way to get mouse back is to alt-tab

# Losing a monitor at runtime
Setup: Connect multiple monitors and run, then unplug one at runtime.
[ ] Display list updates
[ ] Window moves over correct to remaining monitor

# Adding on a monitor at runtime
[ ] Display list updates
[ ] Application continues normally
