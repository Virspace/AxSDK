# DPI Scaling Test
[x] App respects DPI settings by scaling correctly

# Multi-Display DPI Scaling Test
Setup: Configure two monitors, each with different DPI settings
[x] App moves from display to display and accounts for DPI changes between monitors

# Custom cursor
[ ] Normal windows cursor is replaced with custom cursor

# Normal Cursor
Setup: Create decorated window
[x] Cursor is visible inside the client area
[x] Cursor position at the left most pixel of the window equals zero
[x] Cursor position at the right most pixel of the window equals its width
[x] Cursor position at the top most pixel of the window equals zero
[x] Cursor position at the bottom most pixel of the window equals its height
[x] Cursor position stops updating when outside of the window (no negative values)
[x] Cursor position keeps updating even when window not in focus
[x] Cursor position does not keep updating when minimized
[x] Delta is negative in the X and Y axis when going left and up respectively
[x] Delta is positive in the X and Z axis when going right and down respectively

# Hidden Cursor Test
[x] Cursor is invisible while inside the client area but visible again when not
[x] Cursor position at the left most pixel of the window equals zero
[x] Cursor position at the right most pixel of the window equals its width
[x] Cursor position at the top most pixel of the window equals zero
[x] Cursor position at the bottom most pixel of the window equals its height
[x] Cursor position stops updating when outside of the window (no negative values)
[x] Cursor position keeps updating even when not in focus
[x] Cursor position does not keep updating when minimized
[x] Delta is negative in the X and Y axis when going left and up respectively
[x] Delta is positive in the X and Z axis when going right and down respectively

# Disabled Cursor
[x] Cursor X position keeps decreasing as it dragged past the left most pixel on the display
[x] Cursor X position keeps increasing as it dragged past the right most pixel on the display
[x] Cursor Y position keeps decreasing as it dragged past the top most pixel on the display
[x] Cursor Y position keeps increasing as it dragged past the bottom most pixel on the display
[x] Cursor position stops updating when minimized
[x] Cursor position stops updating when not in focus
[X] Clicking well outside the expected client area does not cause window to lose focus
[x] Setting mouse at known position, alt-tabbing into window, moving, and then alt-tabbing back does not move mouse position
[x] Only way to get mouse back is to alt-tab
